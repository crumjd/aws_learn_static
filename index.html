<h1>AWS STATIC TEST</h1>
<p>This is a test of an AWS Static Webpage.  It is based off of the github project <a href="https://github.com/crumjd/aws_learn_static">here</a>.  Its not much to look at, is it?  Honestly, I just don't have any projects that require a website at the moment. So, at the moment, I'll be doing tutorials and problems on HackerRank and putting them here with an "engenearing UI" and a breif explanation of the technology that went into them.</p>
<p>I'll also be trying to come up with something I want to make look pretty.</p>
<p>The exercises:</p>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

<script>
function postCalc() {
  var params = {}
  params.a = $('#operand1').val();
  params.b = $('#operand2').val();
  params.op = $('#operation').find(":selected").text();
  
  $.ajax({
    type: 'POST',
    url: 'https://42ar7wjyc6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/test/calc',
    data: JSON.stringify(params),
    contentType:"application/json",
    dataType:"json",
    success: function(responseData, textStatus, jqXHR) {
		$('#result').val(responseData.c)
    },
    error: function (responseData, textStatus, errorThrown) {
        alert('POST failed.');
    }
  });
}
</script>
<table style="padding: 10px;">
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: left;">(Really) Simple Calculator</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Inputs</td>
    <td>Explanation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    	<input type="number" id="operand1">
    	<select id="operation">
	  <option value="+">+</option>
	  <option value="-">-</option>
	  <option value="*">*</option>
	  <option value="/">/</option>
	</select>
    	<input type="number" id="operand2">
    	 <input type="button" value="=" onclick="postCalc()">
    	<input type="number" id="result" disabled>
    </td>
    <td>
		<p>This exercise is composed of:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The form to the left and a JQuery based JavaScript that pulls the values and constructs a post call to a rest API.</li>
	<li>A rest API which exposes two GET methods a POST method, and an OPTIONS method. One of GETs takes parameters and one interprets the call path for parameters. CORS is enabled for this API it has input checking</li>
	<li>The API passes its data to a simple lambda written for the node.js v10 interpreter. Nothing in the code is terribly interesting, it's mostly just a switch wrapping four simple operations and the required callback architecture.</li>
	<li>An IAM role for the operation of the lambda.</li>
	</ul>
    </td>
	<p>This is all based on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/integrating-api-with-aws-services-lambda.html">this</a> tutorial. I have modified it to interact with the static page and to enable CORS.  Over all, I feel like I understand the API definition the best (mainly because I spent so much time fiddling with CORS) and the execution role the least.</p>
